<h1 align='center'>Indian Startup Funding Analysis</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

This project focuses on investigating the `Indian Startup Ecosystem` in order to propose the best course of action for teams trying to venture into the ecosystem. According to [ADITYA SINGH MANN](https://www.orfonline.org/expert-speak/indian-startup-ecosystem/), India's startup ecosystem is the third largest startup ecosystem in the world with a growing economy, increasing technological advancements disrupting traditional business models, and a large pool of talented individuals.
<p>The scope for Indian startups is immense in various sunrise and sustainable development sectors such as green energy, health tech, deep tech, and clean mobility. Coupled with this is the governmentâ€™s support, with initiatives such as the Startup India programme, Atal Innovation Mission, and Production-Linked Initiative schemes (PLI) that create an environment conducive to their success and growth.</p>
